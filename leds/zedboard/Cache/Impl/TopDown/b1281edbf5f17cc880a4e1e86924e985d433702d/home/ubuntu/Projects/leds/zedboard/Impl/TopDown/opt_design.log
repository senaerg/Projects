Phase 1 Retarget
INFO: [Opt 31-138] Pushed 0 inverter(s) to 0 load pin(s).
WARNING: [Opt 31-143] Automatic BUFG insertion was skipped because there are already at least 12 clock buffers (BUFG and BUFHCE) using global resources.
Resolution: Manually insert a BUFG to drive the high fanout net. However, make sure to first analyze clock buffer utilization to determine if the insertion is safe to perform.
